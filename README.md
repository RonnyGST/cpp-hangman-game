Hangman game made in c++

# How it works

The game involves the user typing the letter they think is in the 5-letter word (or typing the entire word if they are confident they are right). To do this, he must base himself on the tip shown to him. With each correct letter, the word takes shape with the informed letter, however, with each error a piece of the doll will be drawn indicating imminent defeat.
